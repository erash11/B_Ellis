# Force Plate Training Report - Design Specification

**Based on conversation with colleague - November 20, 2024**

---

## Report Philosophy

This report translates force plate metrics into **actionable training recommendations** without prescribing specific exercises. The goal is to:

1. **Categorize athletes** based on force plate trends (Categories 1-7 primary)
2. **Suggest training modalities** (execution styles, not exercises)
3. **Guide periodization decisions** at 4-6 week phase transitions
4. **Respect coach autonomy** - suggest, don't mandate

Key principle: "We're not recreating anything new we haven't already done. We're just dipping back into things we already do, and it's leading us into when and why to use those techniques."

### Color Coding Logic
- 🔴 **Red (Critical)**: Deviation > 2× SWC → Multiple interventions needed
- 🟠 **Orange (Warning)**: Deviation 1.5-2× SWC → Select primary intervention
- 🟡 **Yellow (Caution)**: Deviation 1-1.5× SWC → Monitor, consider one intervention
- 🟢 **Green (Normal)**: Within SWC range → Continue current programming

## Category Definitions & Recommendations

### CATEGORY 1: Maximal Strength Capacity
**Metrics Monitored:**
- IMTP Peak Force ↓
- Net Peak Vertical Force ↓

**WEIGHT ROOM SUGGESTIONS:**
- Heavy isometrics with time-under-tension (TUT) emphasis
- Cluster sets (≥80% 1RM)
- Wave loading protocols
- Longer rest intervals between sets (4-5 min)

**FIELD SUGGESTIONS:**
- Resisted sprints (50-60% velocity decrement)
- Heavy sled pushes

**Execution Notes:**
"Still do your planned exercises (trap bar, safety bar, whatever), but execute them with longer rest, cluster structure, or add isometric holds. Not changing exercises, just changing how we perform them."

---

### CATEGORY 2: Explosive Strength / Rate of Force Development (RFD)
**Metrics Monitored:**
- IMTP Force @ 50ms ↓
- IMTP Force @ 100ms ↓
- IMTP Force @ 200ms ↓

**WEIGHT ROOM SUGGESTIONS:**
- Contrast/complex training (heavy lift → explosive movement)
- Olympic lift variations (60-70% 1RM)
- Accommodating resistance (bands/chains) with fast concentric intent
- Cluster sets with explosive emphasis

**FIELD SUGGESTIONS:**
- Contrast/complex training on field
- Resisted sprints (10-30% velocity decrement)

**Execution Notes:**
"Example: If you planned trap bar deadlifts, pair them with vertical jumps in a superset. Or do jammer press into plyometric push-ups. Still the same movements you planned, just executed as contrasts."

---

### CATEGORY 3: Power Output / Force-Velocity Expression
**Metrics Monitored:**
- Peak Power (CMJ or IMTP) ↓

**WEIGHT ROOM SUGGESTIONS:**
- Contrast/complex training
- Cluster sets (70-80% 1RM)
- Olympic lift variations
- Ballistic movements emphasis

**FIELD SUGGESTIONS:**
- Contrast/complex training
- Resisted sprints (30-50% velocity decrement)

**Execution Notes:**
"Focus on moving submaximal loads with maximal intent. If you're doing power cleans, use cluster sets. If you're doing squats, follow with jump squats."

---

### CATEGORY 4: Stretch-Shortening Cycle (SSC) Efficiency
**Metrics Monitored:**
- RSI-mod ↓
- Eccentric Braking RFD ↓

**WEIGHT ROOM SUGGESTIONS:**
- Reactive/ballistic techniques
- Drop jumps, altitude landings
- Reactive medicine ball work

**FIELD SUGGESTIONS:**
- Plyometric training (pogos, bounds, hurdle hops)
- Reactive agility drills

**Execution Notes:**
"Emphasize quick ground contacts. When doing plyos, focus on minimal ground contact time rather than max height. Think 'hot ground' mentality."

---

### CATEGORY 5: Eccentric Control & Braking Strength
**Metrics Monitored:**
- Eccentric Mean Braking Force ↓
- Eccentric RFD ↓

**WEIGHT ROOM SUGGESTIONS:**
- Eccentrics with TUT (3-5 second down phases)
- Accentuated eccentric overload (105-120% 1RM)
- Tempo squats/RDLs (slow eccentric focus)
- Reverse band work (overload eccentric, deload concentric)

**FIELD SUGGESTIONS:**
- Change of direction drills
- Deceleration-focused work

**Execution Notes:**
"Example: If doing safety bar squats, add a 5-count down. Or use reverse bands where they help on the way up but you control heavy weight on the way down. We've done this before with reverse band squat and bench."

---

### CATEGORY 6: Technical / Coordination Efficiency
**Metrics Monitored:**
- Contraction Time ↑
- Time to Peak Force ↑
- Eccentric RFD changes

**WEIGHT ROOM SUGGESTIONS:**
- Wave loading (varying loads within session)
- Cluster sets
- Rhythmic tempo work (consistent cadence)
- Motor control focus

**FIELD SUGGESTIONS:**
- Movement skill retraining
- Motor control drills
- Technical sprint work (not conditioning)

**Execution Notes:**
"Think movement quality over load. If technique is degrading, reduce intensity and focus on smooth execution. Use wave loading to get quality reps at different intensities."

---

### CATEGORY 7: Asymmetry / Limb Imbalance
**Metrics Monitored:**
- L-R Force Asymmetry > 10%
- L-R Impulse or Power differences

**WEIGHT ROOM SUGGESTIONS:**
- Single-leg/unilateral strength work
- Split-stance patterns (split squats, single-leg RDLs)
- Unilateral jumps and landings
- Offset loading

**FIELD SUGGESTIONS:**
- Unilateral jumps
- Single-leg bounds
- Asymmetrical agility work

**Execution Notes:**
"If squats are programmed, replace with split squats. If doing power cleans, add single-leg box jumps as accessory. Address the imbalance through exercise selection."

---

### CATEGORY 8: Fatigue / Movement Strategy Shift (SECONDARY)
**Metrics Monitored:**
- Contraction Time ↑ + Jump Height ↓
- OR Contraction Time ↑ + Peak Power ↓

**WEIGHT ROOM SUGGESTIONS:**
- Reduce total tonnage 10-20% (one level down)
- Increase rest intervals
- Add mobility/movement prep
- Skill patterning work (low intensity, high quality)

**FIELD SUGGESTIONS:**
- Active recovery sessions
- Lower volume/intensity field work

**Execution Notes:**
"This is a 'tap the brakes' category. Don't change exercises, just reduce volume or intensity by 1 level. If doing 4 sets, drop to 3. If doing 5 reps, drop to 4."

---

### CATEGORY 9: Systemic Fatigue State (SECONDARY)
**Metrics Monitored:**
- RSI-mod ↓ + Peak Power ↓ (both > 10%)

**WEIGHT ROOM SUGGESTIONS:**
- Deload block (reduce load 15-25%, drop 2 levels)
- Active recovery emphasis
- Restoration micro-cycle
- Technical work only

**FIELD SUGGESTIONS:**
- Restoration work
- Active recovery only
- No conditioning

**Execution Notes:**
"🚨 THIS TAKES PRIORITY. If guys hit this category, immediate deload. Don't fight it. Reduce volume and intensity significantly, focus on restoration."

---

## Report Usage Guidelines

### For Coaches

**Timing:**
- Receive report in the **last week of current phase**
- Use to inform **next phase planning** (which is likely already drafted)
- Make **incremental adjustments**, not wholesale rewrites

**Interpretation:**
- **If many athletes are RED** → Prioritize multiple interventions from that category
- **If athletes are YELLOW/ORANGE** → Select 1-2 primary interventions
- **If category is heavily populated** → This should guide phase emphasis
- **If multiple categories flagged** → Start with highest severity, then address others

**Decision Making:**
- The report **suggests**, you **decide**
- Use your coaching judgment and context the data can't see
- Consider: injury history, position demands, competition schedule, mental state

**Making Changes:**
You DON'T need to:
- ❌ Change all exercises
- ❌ Rewrite entire program
- ❌ Add new movements you've never done

You DO need to:
- ✅ Adjust execution style (tempo, rest, pairing)
- ✅ Consider sequencing (superset vs. separate)
- ✅ Modify loading schemes (clusters, wave loading)
- ✅ Keep exercises but change how they're performed

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Spring Phase End**
*Report shows:*
- Category 1 (Max Strength): 12 athletes (8 red, 4 yellow)
- Category 5 (Eccentric): 6 athletes (2 red, 4 yellow)

*Coach Response:*
"Next phase is planned for power emphasis anyway, but I'll make these tweaks:
- Those 8 red flags in Category 1 → Add cluster sets to their main lifts
- Those in Category 5 → Add 5-second eccentrics to their squat variations
- Keep all planned exercises, just modify execution"

**Scenario 2: Summer Phase End**
*Report shows:*
- Category 9 (Systemic Fatigue): 15 athletes (all red/orange)

*Coach Response:*
"🚨 Team needs a deload. Next week was supposed to be a volume push, but data says otherwise. Cutting volume by 20%, increasing rest days, focusing on restoration."

**Scenario 3: Fall Phase End**
*Report shows:*
- Category 4 (SSC): 8 athletes (5 yellow, 3 green)
- Category 2 (RFD): 5 athletes (all yellow)

*Coach Response:*
"Not critical, but worth addressing. Next phase I'll:
- Add more plyometric volume for Category 4 guys
- Use contrast training for Category 2 guys (heavy → explosive)
- Not changing exercises, just emphasis and pairing"

CATEGORIES NOT FLAGGED (All athletes within normal range):
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Category 3: Power Output
✅ Category 4: SSC Efficiency
✅ Category 6: Coordination
✅ Category 7: Asymmetry
✅ Category 8: Movement Strategy
✅ Category 9: Systemic Fatigue

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COACHING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT PHASE:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Priority 1: Category 1 (Max Strength) - 8 CRITICAL FLAGS
→ Implement cluster sets for main lifts
→ Extend rest periods to 4-5 minutes
→ Add isometric holds to squat/deadlift variations

Priority 2: Category 5 (Eccentric) - 2 CRITICAL FLAGS
→ Add 5-second eccentric tempo to squat variations
→ Emphasize deceleration in field work
→ Monitor closely for injury risk

Priority 3: Category 2 (RFD) - 2 CRITICAL FLAGS
→ Use contrast training for main lifts
→ Pair heavy compound movements with explosive variations

NOTE: These recommendations can be implemented without changing
      planned exercises - just modify execution style, rest periods,
      and exercise pairing/sequencing.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Requirements
- 4-6 week rolling average for each metric
- Athlete-specific baseline values
- SWC calculations (0.2 × SD)
- Current value comparison to baseline

### Category Assignment Logic
```
For each athlete:
  For each category:
    Check if ALL metrics in category follow the trend direction
    If YES:
      Calculate deviation from baseline
      Classify severity (red/orange/yellow)
      Assign athlete to category
    If NO:
      Skip this category for this athlete
```

### Color Coding
```
Deviation = |Current - Baseline|
SWC = 0.2 × SD(Baseline)

If Deviation > 2 × SWC → 🔴 Red
If Deviation > 1.5 × SWC → 🟠 Orange
If Deviation > 1 × SWC → 🟡 Yellow
If Deviation ≤ 1 × SWC → 🟢 Green (don't include in report)
```

### Report Generation Timing
- Generate at **end of each training phase**
- Delivery: **Last week of current phase**
- Frequency: **Every 4-6 weeks** (aligned with training phases)
- Format: **PDF or interactive dashboard**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Mock up visual design** in PowerPoint/Figma
2. **Share with coaching staff** for feedback on layout
3. **Validate category recommendations** with strength staff
4. **Build backend logic** to automate report generation
5. **Test with historical data** to ensure accuracy
6. **Pilot with one team** before full deployment

---

## Key Success Factors

✅ **Simple visual hierarchy** - Easy to scan quickly  
✅ **Actionable recommendations** - Clear what to do  
✅ **Respect coach autonomy** - Suggest, don't mandate  
✅ **Incremental changes** - Don't overwhelm with complete rewrites  
✅ **Familiar techniques** - Use methods already in your toolbox  
✅ **Appropriate timing** - Deliver when planning next phase  
✅ **Color-coded urgency** - Prioritize critical issues
